      "While it is commonly thought that the ancient Egyptians were the first to domesticate cats, the oldest known pet cat was recently found in a 9,500-year-old grave on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. This grave predates early Egyptian art depicting cats by 4,000 years or more.\n",
      "In ancient Egypt, killing a cat was a crime punishable by death.\n",
      "In ancient Egypt, mummies were made of cats, and embalmed mice were placed with them in their tombs. In one ancient city, over 300,000 cat mummies were found.\n",
      "When a family cat died in ancient Egypt, family members would mourn by shaving off their eyebrows. They also held elaborate funerals during which they drank wine and beat their breasts. The cat was embalmed with a sculpted wooden mask and the tiny mummy was placed in the family tomb or in a pet cemetery with tiny mummies of mice.\n",
      "Smuggling a cat out of ancient Egypt was punishable by death. Phoenician traders eventually succeeded in smuggling felines, which they sold to rich people in Athens and other important cities.\n",

      "ANSWER:\n",
      "The ancient Egyptians had a deep and revered relationship with cats, making them an integral part of their daily lives and offering various services such as shaving off eye brows during mourning rituals. The ancient Egyptians even held elaborate funeral services for their deceased family members and placed tiny muummies (cat-shaped figures made out of wood) in the family tomb or pet cemeteries with miniature muummies of cat-shaped figures. Smuggling felines from ancient Egypt was punishable by death, but tradepersons were able to sell them to wealthy people in Athens and other cities through their successful trade network.\n"
