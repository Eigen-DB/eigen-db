      "ADDED CONTEXT:\n",
      "While it is commonly thought that the ancient Egyptians were the first to domesticate cats, the oldest known pet cat was recently found in a 9,500-year-old grave on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. This grave predates early Egyptian art depicting cats by 4,000 years or more.\n",
      "In ancient Egypt, killing a cat was a crime punishable by death.\n",
      "In ancient Egypt, mummies were made of cats, and embalmed mice were placed with them in their tombs. In one ancient city, over 300,000 cat mummies were found.\n",
      "When a family cat died in ancient Egypt, family members would mourn by shaving off their eyebrows. They also held elaborate funerals during which they drank wine and beat their breasts. The cat was embalmed with a sculpted wooden mask and the tiny mummy was placed in the family tomb or in a pet cemetery with tiny mummies of mice.\n",
      "Smuggling a cat out of ancient Egypt was punishable by death. Phoenician traders eventually succeeded in smuggling felines, which they sold to rich people in Athens and other important cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSWER:\n",
      "Yes, the ancient Egyptians were highly devoted to owning cats as pets and considered them to be sacred and significant in their society. They believed that cats had powerful energy, good luck, and were associated with the gods, which helped explain their significance and importance in daily life. Cats were also used for hunting, entertainment, and as a source of fur and milk. The ancient Egyptians embalmed and mummified cats during their deaths, which was a sign of respect and admiration. Smuggling felines out of the country was considered a serious offense, leading to severe punishment, even for wealthy traders.\n"
