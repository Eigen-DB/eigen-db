      "While it is commonly thought that the ancient Egyptians were the first to domesticate cat, the oldest known pet cat was recently found in a 9,500-year-old grave on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. This grave predates early Egyptian art depicting cat, which dates back to around 3200 BCE. The ancient Egyptians were notorious for killing cats as a punishment for mischief or misbehavior. In ancient Egypt, muummies were made of felines, and their bodies were placed in tombs for centuries after death. However, family members also held elaborate funeral rituals during which they drew on the earlobes, shaved off their eyebrows, and drained wine from their cups, in order to honor their deceased loved ones. In the ancient city of Avaris, over 300,000 cats were found, with their bodies embalmed with wooden masks, tiny muummies made of wood, and their tiny body parts placed in family tombs or pet ceeterieys. Smuggling a cat out of Egypt for trade was a crime punishable by death.\n"
