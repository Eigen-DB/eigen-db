### Mean similarity search time ≈ `1.4ms`
### Mean embedding insertion time ≈ `2.3ms`

This section showcases the average speed of some key operations in EigenDB.

## How we benchmarked EigenDB

EigenDB was benchmarked using a simple [Python script](https://github.com/Eigen-DB/eigen-db/blob/main/benchmarks/benchmarks.py) which would gather the average time required to perform certain operations. 

There are many parameters that can affect the performance of operations in EigenDB, so many averages were taken for different parameter values.
