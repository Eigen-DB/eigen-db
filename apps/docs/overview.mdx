* EigenDB is a light-weight in-memory vector database written in Go. It's also open-source ‚ù§Ô∏è
* It features the ability to perform similarity search, which utilizes the Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) algorithm ([more](/vector-databases/similarity-search)).
* Basic database operations can easily be performed through its very simple [REST API](/api-reference).

If you know nothing about vector databases, read [this](/vector-databases/vector-databases).
