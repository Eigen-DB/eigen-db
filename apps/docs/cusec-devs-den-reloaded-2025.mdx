During the 2025 Canadian University Software Engineering Conference (CUSEC), I had the incredible opportunity to participate in Dev's Den Reloaded. This was an event geared towards students from all over Canada who wanted to showcase a project they've built. I decided to present EigenDB, and was fortunate enough to win 1st place! 🏆

I cannot express how grateful I am for the support and encouragement I received student community at CUSEC!

[I published a LinkedIn post about the win](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryanawad_machinelearning-ai-datascience-activity-7286442970243825664-lhzq?utm_source=li_share&utm_content=feedcontent&utm_medium=g_dt_web&utm_campaign=copy)
